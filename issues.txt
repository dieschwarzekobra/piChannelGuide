Issues:

#1 UNC Chapel Hill's limited TV Guide
	The TV Guide on channel 99 is terribly aggravating. The music is frustrating, and it's annoying to sit through the whole list just to see what's on channel 100.

#2 Choose a TV Schedule API
#3 Sift through and select only the channels and time zones that apply to the Chapel Hill Area
#4 Make the channel selection process more customizable rather than hard-coded
#5 Select hardware for the project
	## Raspberry pi (including display and display connectors, networking cables, power cable)
	## Programmable remote control?
#6 Select a strategy for making a bootable OS for the raspberry pi
#7 Design the program
	## Read in the API
	## Apply filters
	## Display filtered content
	## Program remote?
	## Design display to make more user friendly, maybe even customizable
#8 Control the television from the pi channel guide (Perhaps a more advanced goal that can happen after the class is over)
