# Contributor Guidelines

THIS IS A DRAFT

## Fork the repo.
You'll probably not have commit access right away, so you'll need to make any changes on your own fork of the repository. You're more than welcome to just open up issues with your suggestions, but it would be best practice to fork and make your changes on yoru own copy of the repository. That way, you can test out your changes on your own.

## Use branches.
Just in case you have a really great idea followed by a really great idea that doesn't necessarily fit the vision for this project. It allows the committers to pick and choose which changes to adopt. It's easy to forget, especially since branches can make things kind of confusing.Take a look at [an explanation about what branching is](http://git-scm.com/book/ch3-1.html) and [documentation about how to use branches](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches) if you're not already familiar with how things work on git.

## Be sure to keep your fork of the repository up to date.
Changes could have been made to the original repository that fixes bugs. It can also make it hard to commit your changes to the original repository if your fork of the repository is not up to date, since conflicts can arise.

## Be sure to use descriptive notes on your commits and pull requests.
That keeps clear what changes you've made and what issues you're addressing. To refer to an issue, just include its number in your commit / pull request messages in the following format: #<number> (i.e. #5).

*Your contributions may not be accepted*. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't keep working away on your fork. You're more than welcome to turn your copy of this project into your own project with your own vision.
